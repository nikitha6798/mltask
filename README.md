step1:
i collected my images from opencv face recognition code and placed in one folder(n0) for test and train and i made another folder(n1) of cat for test & train to do  CNN approch

step2:
i used Mobilenet pretrained model(same as vgg16) code and run the program.found the weight and also accuracy.
i got 99% accuracy for this model.

step3:
Then I fit the model and predicted the output of image(mittu/cat).
